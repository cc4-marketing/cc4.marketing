## 📖 How to use this course

This course is built differently. Instead of watching a video and trying to remember it later, you work alongside an AI instructor.

1.  **Interactive Lessons**: You type slash commands (like `/start-1-1`), and Claude Code will give you instructions, explain concepts, and check your work.
2.  **Real Files**: You will create actual marketing assets (briefs, emails, strategy docs) in the `exercises/` folder.
3.  **Practice Project**: You act as a Strategist at "Markit" (an agency) working for "Planerio" (a B2B client).
